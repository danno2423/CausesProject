	 	<h3>About Habitat for Humanity Philadelphia</h3>
	 	<p1>Habitat for Humanity Philadelphia is an independently chartered affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI), the largest nonprofit homebuilder worldwide.  Locally, our mission is to transform lives and our city by building and repairing homes in partnership with families in need, and uniting all Philadelphians around the cause of affordable housing.  Our vision is a city where all Philadelphians live in safe, affordable homes.  Globally, our vision is a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Our global mission statement:  Seeking to put Godâ€™s love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope.</p1>
	 	<p2>HOW HABITAT FOR HUMANITY PHILADELPHIA WORKS We believe that owning a safe, decent, affordable home is a critical factor in empowering families to build brighter futures for themselves.  Families qualify for our homeownership and home repair programs by showing a need for safe, affordable housing, by meeting income criteria, and by being willing to contribute "Sweat Equity" work on Habitat's projects.  Read more about our affordable housing programs here.  Habitat Philadelphia has served over 500 families since its founding in 1985.  We build within the City of Philadelphia.  Separate Habitat affiliates serve the areas outside Philadelphia--to find your local Habitat for Humanity affiliate, click here.</p2>
