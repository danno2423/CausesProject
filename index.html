			 <h3>What's HOPE Village?</h3>
			 <p>
			 	HOPE Village is the latest Habitat for Humanity build project in Philadelphia, PA.  It's a five home community planned on the 1900 Turner Street block of Philadelphia, PA.  The site broke ground in May 2015 and construction is underway!  Five families will soon call HOPE Village home in the City of Brotherly Love!

			 <h3>Who's building it?</h3>
			 <p>
			 	The Legal and Compliance department of Janney Montgomery Scott LLC! For two days in September, Janney will send 20 employees to put some "sweat equity" into the construction of the site.  But we're not alone - a combination of volunteers and professionals will have this site completed by June 2016. See the 'Cost Estimate' section for what goes into building a Habitat home!

			<h3>How can I help?</h3>
			 <p>
			 DONATE ON GOFUNDME! Habitat for Humanity is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that runs heavily of the generosity of individuals and companies in the communities they build in worldwide.  In addition to helping build, Janney is raising money for the construction of the site.  Please visit the 'Donate' section of the website and consider making a tax-deductible donation that will directly help five families have a decent, affordable home!
